# History Allowlist Manager

A Chrome extension to control which domains are allowed to be recorded in your browser history, using custom regular expressions (regex). All other domains are automatically removed from your history. Optionally, you can apply this rule to incognito mode as well.

---

## Features
- Add, view, and remove allowlist domain patterns using regex.
- Only URLs matching your allowlist are kept in your browsing history.

## Permissions & Why They Are Needed

This extension requests only the permissions necessary for its functionality:

- **history**: To monitor and remove history entries that do not match your allowlist.
- **storage**: To save your allowlist and settings (including incognito preference) locally in Chrome.
- **tabs**: To properly detect incognito context and handle history events accurately.
- **scripting**: Required by Chrome Manifest V3 for background logic and communication between popup and background scripts.
- **<all_urls> (host permissions)**: To ensure the extension can check all visited URLs against your allowlist.

**We do NOT collect, transmit, or share your browsing data. All processing is done locally in your browser.**
